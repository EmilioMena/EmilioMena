- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Emilio Mena
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in software development and data engineering. I have practical experience in both fields at companies like Shopify and Scotiabank where I worked on large, data intensive systems. My prefered stack is Ruby on Rails for backend-development, React for frontend, and Python for data processing & analysis.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently: 
  - Reading [Designing Data-Driven Applications](https://www.amazon.ca/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321) to improve my knowledge and development skills with distributed systems. I'm excited to improve my proficiency in the design of efficient, scalable, consistent and reliable applications. Be on the lookout for my chapter notes!
  - Learning Python web development frameworks, particularly Flask and Django through online tutorials and personal projects
